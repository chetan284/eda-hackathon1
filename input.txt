# Slide 1: Introduction to Distributed Services
- **Title**: Challenges in Monitoring Distributed Services
- **Key Points**:
  - Modern applications are built as distributed microservices.
  - Challenges include:
    - Lack of centralized visibility across services.
    - Difficulty in identifying performance bottlenecks.
    - Complex debugging due to scattered logs, metrics, and traces.
  - Need for a standardized observability solution.

# Slide 2: Introduction to OpenTelemetry
- **Title**: What is OpenTelemetry?
- **Key Points**:
  - Open-source observability framework for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (logs, metrics, traces).
  - Vendor-agnostic: Works with any monitoring tool.
  - Supported by major cloud and monitoring platforms.
- **Pros**:
  - Simplifies observability implementation.
  - Reduces vendor lock-in.
  - Standardizes telemetry data collection.
- **Cons**:
  - Initial setup complexity.
  - Requires consistent instrumentation practices.

# Slide 3: OpenTelemetry Collector
- **Title**: Role of the OpenTelemetry Collector
- **Key Points**:
  - Gateway for telemetry data.
  - Collects, processes, and exports data from applications to monitoring tools.
  - Supports data transformation and enrichment.
- **Why It’s Needed**:
  - Decouples data generation from the monitoring backend.
  - Enables scalability and flexibility in telemetry pipelines.
- **Benefit**: Easy to switch between monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana to Dynatrace) without changing application code.

# Slide 4: Benefits of OpenTelemetry for Organizations
- **Title**: How OpenTelemetry Benefits Your Organization
- **Key Points**:
  - **Cost Savings**: Reduces overhead by reusing instrumentation across tools.
  - **Developer Efficiency**: Streamlines debugging and root cause analysis.
  - **Infrastructure Optimization**: Identifies performance issues proactively.
  - **Standardization**: Promotes a unified approach to telemetry data collection.
